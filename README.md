# FOCS-2017
Foundations of Computer Science, Olin College, Spring 2017

Course Description: 
This course explores the notion of computation. We're going to develop formal tools for defining what we mean by computation, through various forms of automata. We'll develop ways to talk about the efficiency of computations, by quantifying their time complexity. We will examine alternative models of computations, and see how they correspond to different programming paradigms: functional programming, logic programming, and object-oriented programming. We will end with a discussion of basic data structures and algorithms.
